A Reinforcement Learning model to help me trade stocks (like $ASTS).

Run the trainer.py file in order to train the model

Need to add a gymnasium id in order to test it.
Right now it just prints the amount it made after every iteration.
Usually seems to start very negative and get very positive, but some training sessions create bad models.
